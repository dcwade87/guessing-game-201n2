# Code Fellows sea-201n2 Guessing Game
My current project for Code 201.  This is a rough draft version of the readme file for this project, and will be updated as the course progresses.

## User Stories (MVP) of this project as of 1/12/16
  - Design a simple webpage with a game for the user to interact with.
  - The game needs to include a series of questions.  Questions need to log variables, notify the user if they are right or wrong, and/or let them know if their guess is too high/low.
  - Console.logs need to be included for the debugging process.
  - Use github to save the history of the various files as backups.
  - Use a github branch to edit files away from the master branch, and use pull requests to merge and finalize concrete changes (Currently merged as of 1/11/16).

### Stretch Goal of this projects as of 1/12/16
  - Create a while loop in javascript which prompts the user to guess a number until they guess correctly (Included in current version).
